\section{The search algorithms}
In this section, we will discuss about search algorithms, doing a distincion between uninformed and informed search algorithms.
The uninformed algorithms that we will discuss are: Best First (BF).
The informed algorithms that we will discuss are: A* and PEA*.

\subsection{Best first search (\(BF\))}
The uninformed search algorithms are those thay do not use any information about the problem, they just expand the next node in the frontier.
The most important thing that differentiates the various uninformed algorithms is the method they use to expand the next node in the frontier.
Hereafter, we will trate the Best First (BF) search algorithm.

We will start with the "Best First" (BF) search algorithm \cite{algorithms}, which is the basis of informed search algorithms, such as \(A^*\).
BF is based on the idea of idea of expanding the node with the lowest cost. The cost of a node is calculated by the heuristic function \(h(n)\) used. \\
The BF algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Expand the node with the lowest cost \(h(n)\).
\item If the node is the goal, stop.
\item If not, add the node to the list of expanded nodes and expand its children.
\item Repeat from step 1.
\end{enumerate}

You can see a more detailed description and a implementation of the algorithm in Russell's and Norvig's book \cite{algorithms_2}.

\subsection{\(A^*\)}

The informed search algorithms are those that use the any information about the problem to expand the next node in the frontier.\\
The \(A^*\) algorithm is a variation of the BF algorithm. In \(A^*\), use a function \(f\) to evaluate the nodes, this function in \(A^*\) is representate by \(f^*(n)\) and this is the cost of the shortest path from initial to \(n\) conditional on passing through \(n\).
The function \(f^*(n)\) (where n is any node) is defined as equation \ref{eqn:a*}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:a*}
f^*(n) = g^*(n) + h^*(n)
\end{equation}
Where \(g^*(n)\) is the cost of the path from the initial node to the node \(n\), and \(h*(n)\) is the heuristic function that estimates the cost of the path from the node \(n\) to the goal node.

The \(A^*\) algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Expand the node with the lowest cost \(f^*(n)\).
\item If the node is the goal, stop.
\item If not, add the node to the list of expanded nodes and expand its children.
\item Repeat from step 1.
\end{enumerate}

\section{DE AQUI PARA ABAJO = BASURA, LO DEJO DE EJEMPLO}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
\cite{BFS}
